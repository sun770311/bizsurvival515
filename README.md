Open or Closed? NYC Business Survival

## Team Members
Aaron Lee, Hannah Sun, Juan Pablo Reyes Martinez, Pavankumar Suresh, Sreeraj Parakkat

## Project Type
Tool Project

## Questions of Interest
- Can patterns in complaints and local activity help predict whether a business is likely to remain open?
- What neighborhood and environmental factors are associated with business survival versus closure in NYC?
- How do survival patterns vary across business categories, boroughs, and time periods?

## Project Output Goal
The goal of this project is to build an interactive analytical tool that explores and predicts NYC business survival. The final product will combine exploratory visualizations, geographic mapping, and predictive models to show how neighborhood conditions relate to whether businesses stay open or close. Users will be able to explore survival patterns by location, business type, and time, and view model-based survival estimates.
