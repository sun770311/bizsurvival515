## Milestone 2 — Technology Review & First Demo (Due: Feb 24)

### Goal
Select the appropriate Python library to support a key technology requirement (e.g., interactive map visualization) and demonstrate its feasibility.

### Tasks (in priority order)
1. Define the technology need and relevant use case (e.g., interactive spatial map)  
2. Identify 2–3 candidate Python libraries (e.g., Bokeh, Dash, Google Maps, etc.)  
3. Install and test each candidate library  
4. Evaluate libraries based on:
   - ability to meet project requirements  
   - compatibility with Python 3 and project stack  
   - ease of use and documentation quality  
   - computational efficiency for dataset size  
   - stability / absence of blocking bugs  
5. Produce side-by-side comparison of the libraries  
6. Select final library and justify the choice  
7. Document drawbacks and risks of the chosen library  
8. Prepare demo (screen recording or live demonstration)  
9. Write the Technology Review Markdown document  
10. Upload writeup and demo to `docs/technology_review/` in GitHub

## Milestone 3 — Core System Implementation (Feb 24 – March 3)

### Goal
Develop the core components of the system and ensure end-to-end functionality for main use cases.

### Tasks (in priority order)
1. Implement DataManager (data retrieval, filtering, formatting)  
2. Implement GeoService (spatial queries and spatial joins)  
3. Implement AnalyticsEngine (survival scoring and ranking)  
4. Integrate components together (Data → Spatial → Model → Visualization flow)  
5. Implement base map visualization and pins (look into Mapbox) 
6. Verify data pipeline correctness and performance  
7. Internal testing for Use Cases 1–3
